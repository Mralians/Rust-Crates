A macro for declaring lazily evaluated statics in Rust.

Using this macro, it is possible to have `static`s that require code to be executed at runtime in order to be initialized. This includes anything requiring heap allocations, like vectors or hash maps, as well as anything that requires non-const function calls to be computed.



```rust
#[macro_use]
extern crate lazy_static;

use std::collections::HashMap;

lazy_static! {
    static ref HASHMAP: HashMap<u32, &'static str> = {
        let mut m = HashMap::new();
        m.insert(0, "foo");
        m.insert(1, "bar");
        m.insert(2, "baz");
        m
    };
}

fn main() {
    // First access to `HASHMAP` initializes it
    println!("The entry for `0` is \"{}\".", HASHMAP.get(&0).unwrap());

    // Any further access to `HASHMAP` just returns the computed value
    println!("The entry for `1` is \"{}\".", HASHMAP.get(&1).unwrap());
}
```
